# **THE ANALYSIS**

Each query in this project addresses a specific aspect of the data analyst job market. Here's a breakdown of how I approached the analysis:

### 1. **Top-Paying Data Analyst Jobs**

To pinpoint the most lucrative roles, I analyzed job postings based on average yearly salary and remote availability. The results highlight the highest-paying opportunities in the field.

```sql
SELECT
    job_id,
    job_title,
    job_title_short,
    job_location,
    job_schedule_type,
    salary_year_avg,
    job_posted_date,
    name as company_name
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    LEFT JOIN company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL and
    job_location = 'Anywhere'
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT
    10;
```

#### **Insights:**
- Salaries range from $184,000 to $650,000, reflecting the potential for significant earnings.  
- Companies like Meta, SmartAsset, and AT&T stand out as top employers.  
- Job titles vary, from **Data Analyst** to **Director of Analytics**, showcasing diverse opportunities.

### 2. **Skills for Top-Paying Jobs**

This query explores the specific skills required for the highest-paying roles by joining job postings with skill data.

```sql
WITH top_paying AS (
    SELECT
        job_postings_fact.job_id,
        job_title,
        job_title_short,
        salary_year_avg,
        name as company_name
    FROM
        job_postings_fact
        LEFT JOIN company_dim on job_postings_fact.company_id = company_dim.company_id
    WHERE
        job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
        salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL and
        job_location = 'Anywhere'
    ORDER BY
        salary_year_avg DESC
    LIMIT 10
)
SELECT
    top_paying.*,
    skills
FROM top_paying
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on top_paying.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
ORDER BY
    salary_year_avg DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### **Insights:**
- **SQL** is the most frequently required skill for high-paying roles, followed by **Python** and **Tableau**.  
- Advanced technical skills like **R**, **Snowflake**, and **Excel** also play a key role.

### 3. **In-Demand Skills for Data Analysts**

This query identifies the most frequently requested skills in job postings.

```sql
SELECT
    skills,
    count(skills_job_dim.job_id) as demand
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND
    job_work_from_home = TRUE
GROUP BY
    skills
ORDER BY
    demand DESC
LIMIT 5;
```

#### **Top Skills:**
- **SQL** and **Excel** remain foundational.  
- Programming skills like **Python** and visualization tools such as **Tableau** and **Power BI** are increasingly critical.

    skills,
    round(avg(salary_year_avg),0) as Average_salary
FROM
    job_postings_fact
    INNER JOIN skills_job_dim on job_postings_fact.job_id = skills_job_dim.job_id
    INNER JOIN skills_dim on skills_job_dim.skill_id = skills_dim.skill_id
WHERE
    job_title_short = 'Data Analyst' AND salary_year_avg IS NOT NULL
GROUP BY
    skills
